# Data-science-Stock-price-forecasting
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using a variety of machine learning models. The aim is to predict the closing prices of stocks based on historical data. Our team has employed five different models to achieve this goal and documented our findings in a research paper.

Models Used
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Ridge Regression
Linear Regression with Weighted Moving Average
Gradient Boosting
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in our project. It includes:

Date Formatting: Standardizing date formats to ensure consistency.
Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing data points.
Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and mitigating the impact of outliers.
Normalization and Standardization: Scaling features to improve model performance.
Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features for model training.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
models/: Contains the trained models and scripts for training.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
